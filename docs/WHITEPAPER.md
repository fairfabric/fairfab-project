## Overview

**FairFabProject** is a decentralized project management token under the **[FairFabric](https://github.com/fairfabric/)** ecosystem.

## Philosophy

FairFabProject promotes **solidarity economics** and **decentralized governance**. It encourages **freedom** and **self-management** in project execution. All contributors are equal participants, but the **Product Owner** is the sole decision-maker. The Product Owner can be an individual or an organization.

## Key Roles

- **Initiators**: The creators of the project, referred to as **project initiators**.
- **Product Owner**: The **Product Owner** is the sole owner of the NFT and the project. They are the only one who can approve new contributors and decide on project management. They also define the rules for **contributor remuneration** and **profit-sharing**.

## How it Works

- **Project NFT**: Each project has a unique NFT that includes details like the **project roadmap**, **whitepaper**, **remuneration rules**, and **profit-sharing agreements**.
- **Contributor Remuneration**: Contributors are rewarded in **FairFabric tokens** based on their participation, as defined in the NFT smart contract. The reward tokens are shared equitably among participants, except for the portion reserved for the **Product Owner**.
- **Commission**: The **Product Owner** receives a commission, defined in the NFT, on every contribution and transaction.
- **Mint Cost**: The cost to mint a FairFabProject NFT is **1 MATIC**, but this amount can be customized in the NFT.
